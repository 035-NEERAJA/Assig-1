The last two columns of the naval dataset attached here are output columns, the last column is
turbine decay state coefficient and the second last one is compressor decay state coefficient
1. On naval dataset plot a Kernel density of Compressor Decay State Coefficient, and then
    answer the following question
    What kind of distribution does Compressor Decay State Coefficient have?
2. Draw a scatterplot matrix on the naval dataset and watching the diagram name any two
    features which are linearly related to most of the other features.
3. Apply Min-Max scaling on the naval dataset.
4. From the naval dataset find out mean and median of both the outputs.
5. From R- MASS library use the Boston dataset and then answer the following questions
    Who has the lowest salary?
     Who does work in HR?
6. Load the Titanic dataset (inbuilt to R), then find out how many male child survived?
     How many first class passengers were there?
